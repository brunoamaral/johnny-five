# johnny-five

Johnny Five is an API for your raspberrypi to interface with the Maker channel from IFTTT. 

The features so far are simple. He turns on a monitor, fires up kodi, turns on Philips Hue lights and reacts when I arrive or leave home.

At sunset and sunrise, Johnny turns the lights on or off.

It's not much, yet he is a good example on how a very simple script can improve your daily routines.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please get in touch.

**Not to be confused** with http://johnny-five.io/ the JavaScript robotics and IoT programming framework, developed at Bocoup, based on Arduino Firmata Protocol that can be found here: https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five
